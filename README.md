# lifehudweb

This is the first iteration of an app with the goal in mind to convert it over to a mobile app.
The idea is to solve problems on the web side of things using ReactJS in hopes that transitioning over to
ReactNative will be easier.

# App functionality

This app is a twist on a Todo app.  It is catered towards gamers giving you a "Condition" that is a calculation of tasks
completed for the month.  The goal is to fill your healthbar to 100% by completing the tasks you set up.  This will need to
feature having reoccurring tasks.

# Bonus Features

As a bonus feature there will also be support for adding quick notes.  These will display at the bottom of your HUD.
